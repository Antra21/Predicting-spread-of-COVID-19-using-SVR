# Predicting spread of COVID-19 using SVR
This project is based on prediction of COVID-19 cases from the live dataset from 22 January 2020 to 4 May 2020.This repository contains the project.

## Features

1. Model was trained using Support Vector Regressor.
2. The model was prepared to fit in best estimators and after the we take the best parameters from them.
3. Model was trained upto 3 cross validations of the training sets.
4. MAE and MSE scores were used to check the losses.
5. Predict the future spread of COVID-19 for next 15 days.
